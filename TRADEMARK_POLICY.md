This document outlines the policy governing the use of the project names, logos, author names, and other identifying marks associated with the Agora-Supercluster and its related projects.

**Note:** Some of these marks, such as "Human-AI Collaboration" and "policy-as-code," are also general terms used to describe a concept or practice. This policy does not restrict their general, descriptive use. It applies when these terms are used as an identifier for a specific project, product, or service in a way that could cause confusion with the works of the Agora-Supercluster.

## 2. Permitted Uses

You may use the Project Marks in the following ways, provided such use does not mislead others or cause confusion:

*   **Describe your work's compatibility with or dependency on our projects.** (e.g., "This is a visualization tool for GAAF.")
*   **Create forks or derivative works, provided it is clear that they are not the official project.** (e.g., "My fork, 'My-Senate', is based on Senate-Thinking.")
*   **Accurately report on or discuss the projects and the author's work.**

## 3. Restricted Uses

You must not use any of the Project Marks in a way that suggests official endorsement, sponsorship, or affiliation with the original projects or author, unless you have obtained explicit prior written permission. This includes, but is not limited to:

*   Using the marks as part of your own product, service, or company name. (e.g., "The Agora-Supercluster Company" or "Heliocentric Pro")
*   Creating merchandise with the marks that implies it is official.
*   Using the marks in a domain name that could be confused with an official project site.
*   Using the author names (`unya torisan`, `torisan unya`) to imply that the author is a direct participant in or endorser of your own project or product.

If you are uncertain whether your intended use falls under permitted or restricted use, please contact us before proceeding.

## 4. Logos and Graphical Assets (if and when created)

This section applies if and when official logos or other graphical assets are created for the projects.

*   **Use for Reference:** Official logos may be used, unmodified, for the purpose of referring to the projects, such as in articles, presentations, or on websites that link to the official project repositories.
*   **Modification Prohibited:** You may not modify, alter, or combine the official logos with other graphics to create a new logo.
*   **Endorsement:** Using a project logo must not imply endorsement by the project or its author.
