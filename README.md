This project aims to realize a "co-creative society" where everyone can participate in policymaking. Our innovative approach is **"Policy-as-Code"**: treating policies and consensus-building processes as version-controlled, transparent code. This allows anyone to audit the history of societal rules‚Äîwho proposed what, when, and why.

This repository serves as the central hub for this exploration and is part of the **[Agora-Supercluster](https://github.com/torisan-unya/Agora-Supercluster)**, a research ecosystem dedicated to advancing Human-AI Collaboration (HAC).

## üìú The Vision

### Why This Project, Why Now?

The challenges facing our society are becoming increasingly complex. Yet, the process of debating and deciding on solutions is often confined to a few experts and representatives, remaining distant for most citizens.

This project aims to break down that wall.

*   **For Citizens and Activists:**
    Imagine a new form of democracy where your voice and ideas don't just end as "opinions" but are shaped into concrete "policy drafts" in collaboration with others. We envision a future where powerful tools like AI are in the hands of citizens, enabling collective intelligence to drive society forward. For example, when creating rules for a local park, AI could organize residents' opinions, and everyone could propose revisions via Git.

*   **For Engineers and Technologists:**
    Imagine a world where ambiguous, unstructured policy debates are version-controlled with Git, improvements are proposed via Pull Requests, and impacts are predicted with automated tests. Just as `Infrastructure as Code` revolutionized infrastructure management, `Policy-as-Code` is a grand technical challenge that can revolutionize governance‚Äîthe operating system of society. For instance, creating a system to track the history of policy changes to prevent past mistakes.

## üí° What is "Policy-as-Code"?

**Policy-as-Code** is a method of describing and managing policies, laws, rules, and agreements in a format that is readable by both humans and machines (i.e., code).

This approach creates several key benefits:

*   **Transparency:** Like a `git log`, you can see at a glance who changed a policy proposal, when, and how.
*   **Collaboration:** Anyone can propose improvements and discuss them in an open forum through `Pull Requests`.
*   **Reproducibility and Verifiability:** Anyone can trace and verify the logic behind a policy decision, facilitating AI-driven simulations and impact assessments. For example, predicting the impact of a policy numerically to identify potential problems in advance.
*   **Reusability:** Excellent policy logic and consensus-building patterns can be reused in other regions or communities.

**A note of caution:** When using AI, always verify information against reliable sources to avoid hallucinations. This project includes guidelines to minimize such risks.

## üöÄ What This Repository Provides

This repository is a toolbox for implementing "Policy-as-Code". It is positioned as a proposal, and we encourage you to use this framework as a reference for your own practice.

*   **ü§ñ AI Prompts ([`/prompts/en/`](./prompts/en/))**
    *   A collection of prompts to assist AI in analyzing policy issues, organizing arguments, and generating draft clauses.
    *   **Example**: A prompt could be used to analyze a complex issue like a nation's declining birthrate. The AI would summarize economic, social, and political impacts and generate concrete proposals (e.g., methods for distributing childcare support funds), providing a structured foundation for debate.

*   **üõ† Toolkit (`/tools`)**
    *   Scripts for converting policy proposals into structured data, visualization tools, etc.
    *   **Installation**: In a Python environment, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`. For example, the `policy_to_code.py` script converts a text-based policy proposal into JSON format, making it manageable with Git.

*   **üìö Documentation (`/docs`)**
    *   The project's philosophy, tutorials, and contribution guidelines.
    *   **Example**: The tutorial explains the steps to create a simple community guideline using Policy-as-Code. We recommend starting with a small group.

*   **üèõÔ∏è Use Cases (`/use-cases`)**
    *   A collection of case studies applying this project to specific policy issues (e.g., creating rules for a local park, revising the terms of an online community).
    *   **Example for Park Rules**: Gather opinions from residents, analyze impacts with an AI prompt (e.g., the economic effect of adding more playground equipment). Propose changes via Pull Requests to build consensus. Simulated Outcome: A potential 2x increase in community participation.
