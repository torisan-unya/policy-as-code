This project pioneers **"Policy-as-Code"**: a paradigm for encoding policies, laws, and agreements as version-controlled, machine-readable code to foster transparent, collaborative governance. As part of the **[Agora-Supercluster](https://github.com/torisan-unya/Agora-Supercluster)** ecosystem, it advances Human-AI Collaboration (HAC) for societal decision-making.

## üìú The Vision

### Why Policy-as-Code, Why Now?

Societal challenges grow more intricate, yet policymaking remains opaque and elite-driven. Policy-as-Code democratizes this process by leveraging Git for auditing changes and AI for impact simulations, enabling collective intelligence.

- **For Citizens and Activists:** Transform opinions into auditable policy drafts via Git Pull Requests, with AI organizing inputs for equitable participation‚Äîe.g., simulating local park rule impacts on community cohesion.
- **For Engineers and Technologists:** Apply Infrastructure-as-Code principles to governance: version policies, run automated tests for ripple effects, and prevent historical errors through traceable commits.

Recent research underscores the urgency: Human-AI teams enhance decision-making in complex environments, reducing bias and amplifying diverse voices in policy contexts.

## üí° Core Principles of Policy-as-Code

Policy-as-Code formalizes rules in human- and machine-readable formats (e.g., YAML or Python), yielding:

- **Transparency:** `git log` reveals policy evolution‚Äîwho, when, why.
- **Collaboration:** Open Pull Requests for iterative refinements.
- **Verifiability:** AI-driven simulations test outcomes, e.g., economic forecasts via code execution.
- **Reusability:** Modular policies adaptable across contexts, from community guidelines to national regulations.

**Caution:** AI outputs require verification against primary sources to mitigate hallucinations; this repo includes debiasing prompts.

## üöÄ Repository Contents

This hub offers practical tools for Policy-as-Code adoption, starting small (e.g., community rules) and scaling to institutional use.

- **ü§ñ AI Prompts ([`/prompts/en/`](./prompts/en/)):**  
  Specialized prompts for policy analysis and drafting. The flagship **[Policy Analysis Prompt v5.6](./prompts/en/policy-analysis-prompt-v5.6-en.md)** enables multi-faceted ripple-effect assessments, drawing on causal inference for countermeasures‚Äîideal for debating issues like declining birthrates with economic/social projections.

- **üõ† Toolkit ([`/tools`](./tools)):**  
  Scripts for structuring policies (e.g., `policy_to_code.py` converts text to JSON for Git management). Install: `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Supports simulations like impact modeling on inequality.

- **üìö Documentation ([`/docs`](./docs)):**  
  Tutorials on Git-based consensus-building, e.g., revising online community terms with phased reviews.

- **üèõÔ∏è Use Cases ([`/use-cases`](./use-cases)):**  
  Real-world examples, such as park rule co-creation: AI analyzes resident inputs, yielding 2x participation gains via simulated outcomes.
