# Project "Agora-Supercluster" License

This document, along with its addendum [`PATENT_LICENSE_ADDENDUM.md`](PATENT_LICENSE_ADDENDUM.md), forms the complete legal licensing framework for this project. The project is dual-licensed to appropriately cover its distinct components: software code and academic/documentary content.

Individual source files should contain their own `SPDX-License-Identifier` tag (e.g., `SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT` for code, `SPDX-License-Identifier: CC-BY-SA-4.0` for documents) to ensure clarity for automated tools.

## Dual-License Structure Overview

This project is comprised of two primary types of content, each governed by a separate license:

1.  **The "Code" Component:** All files primarily consisting of software source code, scripts, and configuration files are licensed under the **MIT License** (see Section 1).
2.  **The "Paper" Component:** All files primarily consisting of academic papers, research documentation, figures, and datasets are licensed under the **Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0) License** (see Section 2).

For hybrid content, such as a Jupyter Notebook, the license applies to its constituent parts: **code cells are governed by the MIT License**, while **Markdown/text cells are governed by the CC BY-SA 4.0 License**, unless explicitly stated otherwise within the file.
